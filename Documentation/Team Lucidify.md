    - Optional meeting time, less focused on planning, more focused on breaking down issues, mobbing, etc.
    - Occasionally follow up with drinks, food, etc.

## Scrum Process

The team has agreed to use the Scrum methodology to stay agile and effectively respond to upcoming deadlines.

The team leverages Scrum by operating on one-week sprints. Every sprint, design, implementation, documentation, and testing will be completed to deliver products incrementally. Each sprint begins and ends at 5PM every Monday. In order for a sprint deliverable to be considered completed during that sprint, it must be delivered before that time. Sprint deliverables should not have a deadline before the sprint boundary.

The three pillars of Scrum are transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Each pillar is supported by the way we execute the project:

- Transparency
    - We provide each other daily updates (standups) on a team-visible forum (Discord)
    - We bring up issues with our work, our process, and our teammates to other teammates through a team-visible forum as fast as possible
    - We present our advisor any impediments or at-risk deadlines as soon as we can
- Inspection
    - Everything that makes it into the final draft of the project undergoes review by other teammates (through pull requests, pair/mob programming, etc.)
    - We hold weekly sprint review sessions to inspect our teammates' progress
    - We show our progress to our advisor weekly for feedback
- Adaptation
    - We work on a one-week sprint lifecycle to allow us to rapidly adapt our work and process
    - We hold grooming and planning sessions at each sprint boundary to ensure we adapt each work item to the priority of the project's deadlines
    - We hold weekly sprint retrospectives to investigate ways to improve our process
    - We are willing to modify our process based on team dynamic, what needs to be delivered, and how fast it needs to be delivered

## Scrum Meeting Sessions

Our sprints begin and end on Monday, so we hold a few review sessions at the beginning of our Monday meetings:

- Sprint Review
    - 20 minutes
    - Each teammate demonstrates the progress they have made during the sprint
    - They demonstrate how they work they have done fits into the project as a whole
    - Other teammates provide constructive feedback
    - Write up sprint document to report on progress made during
- Sprint Retrospective
    - 15 minutes
    - We discuss as a team what went particularly well and poorly during the sprint
    - We propose options and changes that can be implemented to improve the next sprint
- Backlog Grooming
    - 15 minutes
    - We go through pending work items and prioritize the backlog
    - We ensure the prioritized backlog reflects the current state of what is done, what needs to be done immediately, and what needs to be done later
- Sprint Planning
    - 20 minutes
    - We go through the prioritized backlog and assign an effort level to the highest priority items
    - After effort level estimation, we delegate each work item to one or more team members
    - We try to only take the tasks we think we can finish or make meaningful progress on during the upcoming sprint
