# Technology and Concept Analysis - Frontend Framework

## Criteria

Along with the universal criteria for all our technologies, we added the following specifically to the frontend for evaluation.

- **Maturity** - Defines how new or old the framework is. Older frameworks will be less buggy than newer ones because they wil have been used more and gone through rigorous testing
  whereas newer frameworks won't have as much mileage and may be riddled with bugs.
- **Community** - Defines how large of a community actively uses the framework. The larger the community, the more likely we can get help on sections we get stuck on.
- **Learning Curve** - Defines how easy or hard it is to jump right into coding and making an actual product.
- **Performance** - Defines how fast the framework operates and how many resources it consumes.

## Options

We evaluated these 3 frameworks because they are the most used as of 2017 and the most viable for web applications.

- **Angular** -
    - **Maturity** - Rating: 4 - Has been out for awhile
    - **Community** - Rating: 5 - Large Community. Built by Google.
    - **Ease-of-use** - Rating: 2 - Compared to the others, a lot more code and complexity to the functions.
    - **Familiarity** - Rating: 2 - We would have to learn TypeScript
    - **Learning Curve** - Rating: 1 - Large learning curve due to the fact we would have to use TypeScript and the framework is slightly more complex than React and Vue
    - **Performance** - Rating: 4 - Fast, but it comes pre-installed with a bunch of useless tools that would bog down the application a bit. Nothing significant, but should still
    be considered.
    - **Notes** - Used by Google, Wix, weather.com, healthcare.gov and Forbes. Comes with a bunch of tools that may or may not be helpful and extremely confusing. 2-way data binding. Uses TypeScript, which may make things even more complex and time-consuming.

- **React** -
    - **Maturity** - Rating: 4 - Has been out for awhile. Not quite as long as Angular, but the difference is negligible
    - **Community** - Rating: 5 - Large community. Built by Facebook.
    - **Ease-of-use** - Rating: 4 - Code complexity seems less than Angular, but slightly more than Vue.
    - **Familiarity** - Rating: 4 - Uses Javascript which several of the team members have experience with
    - **Learning Curve** - Rating: 3 - Small learning curve compared to Angular
    - **Performance** - Rating: 4 - Fast
    - **Notes** - Used by Airbnb, Uber, Netflix, Twitter, Pinterest, and Reddit. 1-way data binding. Uses Javascript.

- **Vue** -
    - **Maturity** - Rating: 4 - New. Has been the fastest growing framework in 2017.
    - **Community** - Rating: 4 - Smaller community. Built by Ex-Google employee
    - **Ease-of-use** - Rating: 5 - Simple, clean code. Pretty much just javascript and you choose what you want rather than pulling in tools that won't be used.
    - **Familiarity** - Rating: 5 - Uses Javascript and less, more readable code than React
    - **Learning Curve** - Rating: 4 - Small learning curve.
    - **Performance** - Rating: 5 - Very fast
    - **Notes** - Used by Nintendo, Alibaba, and GitLab. Extremely clean and light. Both 2-way and 1-way data binding. Uses Javascript. Was made to be the best parts of Angular and React combined.
