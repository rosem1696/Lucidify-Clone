# Team Lucidify - Trello Guide

## About

This is a set of rules, definitions, and instructions Team Lucidify has defined for using Trello.

## Processes

### Merge Request Links

 The GitLab Powerup is added to team Boards. All Merge Requests that are made should be added to a corresponding Card in Trello using this Powerup.  

 To add a link to a card:
1. Click on the Card you want to add a merge request to.
2. Under the "Powerups" section on the right side of the Card menu, click on "GitLab".
3. Click "Attach Merge Request" from the dropdown menu.
4. Select the repository containing the Merge Request from the dropdown.
5. Select the desired Merge Request from the dropdown. This will add the link as an attachment to the Card.

## Labels

Labels are used to sort Cards categorically. Each label has a name and a corresponding color. All Cards should have one or more labels added to them.

**Spike (Green) -** A task that doesn't produce any specific deliverable. Usually refers to a research or hack/prototyping task.

**Deliverable (Yellow) -** A task that is directly a sprint deliverable. Only one card should be labeled for each specific deliverable item. At least one other label should be applied alongside any Deliverable label.

**Internal Improvement (Orange) -** A task that doesn't have a direct effect on users or product features. Generally this is cleaning, performance, or back-end improvement.

**Bug (Red) -** A task for fixing an issue found in a product.

**Development (Purple) -** A task for implementing or improving a feature in a product.

**Documentation (Blue) -** A task for adding or updating team and product documentation.

**Discussion (Seafoam) -** A task that involves the team discussing and deliberating on an idea.
