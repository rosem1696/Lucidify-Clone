## Team Interaction and Communication Guidelines

### General

- Professionalism
    - Communication is generally casual/informal.
    - A moderate level of professionalism is maintained during formal team meetings.
    - A high level of professionalism is expected for all formal meetings with individuals outside of Team Lucidify.
- Attitude and Demeanor
    - Members are expected to interact kindly and respectfully with one another.
    - To promote a strong team dynamic, members are encouraged to interact socially outside of work.
    - Members are encouraged to plan and join in informal "Social Outings" outside of work.
    - Members are to treat other members as equals while still following team assigned responsibilities.
    - All work done is important and is valued.
        - Jobs and responsibilities will have different priority to their specific project. This results in some work being objectively more important to the team.
        - The team values all work done based on the time spent, effort placed, and quality produced.
- Work and Fault Responsibility
    - Members should never be afraid to ask for help from other members.
    - Members should prioritize working and seeking help to prevent racing against or missing deadlines.

### Remote Communication Conduct

- Channel topics are strictly enforced to ensure communication is organized and recorded.
- Non-Project remote communication is encouraged, but should be contained within the designated channels.
- Mentions/Pings to everyone or specific members are to be addressed in a timely manner.
- All communication that occurs in project channels is considered documentation. Communication in these channels must maintain a moderate level of professionalism.
- Vocal remote communication maintains the same standards as in person communication (See General/Professionalism)

### Meeting Conduct

- Meetings are treated as "On The Clock" time for the team. This time is a cost from which productivity is produced.
- Team and per issue leaders are responsible for maintaining the productivity of the team as a whole.
- Each team member is responsible for maintaining their own focus and productivity during meetings.
- Any discussion is always promoted over no discussion. However, discourse should always be geared towards projects or items being discussed.
- Interrupting team members is highly discouraged, particularly when a member is explaining or pitching an idea.
- The team will take short breaks after completion of each reasonably sized task to ensure refreshed focus and thought.

### Idea Proposal and Approval

- All members may propose ideas to the team.
- Proposals may be done informally through remote or in person communication, or formally during a team meeting.
    - Formal proposal must be used for significant project and process ideas.
- Members approve ideas and changes proposed by other members
    - Significant ideas and changes are approved by all members.
    - Most less significant ideas and changes are approved by at least one other member.
